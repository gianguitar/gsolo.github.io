		<p><b>New Single "Stay" Available on All Streaming Platforms 8/27!</b></p>

		<p>I'm excited to announce that my new single "Stay" will be available on all streaming platforms on August 27th! I wrote pieces of the lyrics to Stay in different areas of Los Angeles, hence why the lyrics are strung loosely. But the gist of the song is literally no secret, it’s a song about someone that is begging for their partner, lover or acquaintance to stay the night, instead of hitting the road. Whether it’d be for love, comfort, accompaniment, camaraderie or just not wanting to be alone, the ask is real. Sometimes, at this point in time, lasting friendships are made or broken. I wanted to capture all of those emotions. Please stay tuned for more info!</p>

		<p>I recently did a spot for <a href="https://www.mvmt.com/">MVMT</a> and I had a blast creating the content. I love lifeystyle brands that promote the same lifestyle that I do within my life and MVMT is one of those brands. 
		MVMT inspires to live life on your own terms and I totally agree. It is the ultimate way to live. In part of MVMT's good nature, I have been given the chance to offer any of my fans a 15% discount code to anything on MVMT's website! <a href="https://mvmt.cc/giansolo15">Click Here</a>! 
		I myself own the Ember Black watch and the Tortoise-Green Reveler sunnies and they are amazing. They are absolute quality and a great build. As a brand ambassador, I can also say that I'm a fan of the brand. But I'll tell you what, 
			I'll stop ranting now so you can go ahead and go on and get your <a href="https://mvmt.cc/giansolo15">15% discount code</a> to purchase any sunnies, watches, etc. on MVMT's website!</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Singer/Songwriter-Producer from North Hollywood, CA. 
<br /><br />
After years of putting in work with multiple projects, Gian is going solo to present a different side of his musical self. Gian holds nothing back on his latest music and dives deep into the wide depth of his musical greatness and brevity. 
<br /><br />
This is Gian, free from any musical limitations.     
<br /><br />
“Embracing who you are and where you stand in life is something that takes time to accept. Growing older has made me see things in a different light and I am in a place where I feel that life is absolutely worth every single moment. Throughout life and all of its changes, so far, music has been there, changing, adapting, helping and giving me life, comfort and energy at times when I need it. It’s time to give back. The only way for me to do that is to create and release songs that do the same for people. Give life, comfort and energy back to the people. I’ve created music that inspires, drives and harnesses positivity, solidarity and happiness and I am ready to give back.”
<br /><br />
Gian Solo's latest single, entitled "Come Back to Me," is set for release on 4/20/21 through Bandcamp.
<br /><br />
"Come Back to Me" is a self-produced single by Gian Solo with ardent but honest lyrics that soar through a lush texture of natural acoustic background. The emotional energy of the song is carried by Gian's lyrics that tell the story of a person's longing for an ex-love from the past. This song was recorded, mixed and mastered at Gian's personal home studio.	
<br /><br />
Gian is set to release music throughout the rest of the year, stay tuned and keep your eyes on the news section.</p>
